Canine Biometric is a project that utilizes the MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) feature extraction technique and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to generate a unique voiceprint for a target dog and recognize it later. This repository serves as a guide to understand and implement the Canine Biometric system effectively.
